            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I consider myself a very passionate person when something catches my interest, I won’t let go until I know how and why it works. 
                <br><br>
                When I was a little kid, I viewed the world as full of possibilities. Everything held a question of an answer I needed to find. These questions lead me to study nanotechnology, the science of the small things. The theory of it was amazing and how you could create tiny but really useful things. But I wasn't able to see them and enjoy them, so my curiosity wasn't fulfilled. 
                <br><br>
                It was until I found that I could make something from scratch and that I could enjoy it using only code, that I felt at peace.
