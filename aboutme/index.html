    <h2>Lui</h2>
    <p>Hello friends, I'm Lui from Mexico, this is my first semester, and I'm working to earn a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology, and I am excited to be here and learn all I can. If you have any suggestions for methods of study they are welcome.    </p>
    <p>I currently live with my dog named Kai (picture for reference). If I had to choose one hobby to do for the rest of my life, it would be reading. Especially romance fantasy novels, if they are part of a series better. </p>
